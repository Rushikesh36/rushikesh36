# Hi, I’m Rushikesh 👋

I’m a software engineer who enjoys building clean, scalable web systems and understanding how things work end-to-end — from UI architecture to backend logic and data flow.

I’m currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Northeastern University, and I’ve previously worked on production systems used by millions of users.
